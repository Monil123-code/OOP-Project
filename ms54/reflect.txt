There are many challanges and issues that I faced while completing the MS5 project.
To begin with MS51, while I was working on MS51. I was not able to sort the items.
Which was latter solved by you in the class itself by modifying the bubble sort. 
Secondly, while submitting the MS51 I had memory leaks. which was solved by putting
delete Iptr[i] in a loop. I was working on MS52 parallely with MS51. Which was comparatively
 easy as I had to add the item. As I was was working together and after the issue in
 MS51 was solved it also solved the memory leaks in MS52. After that I had som minor 
printing issues and to solve that I had to modify my old files like the Item or Date.
 After, that I began to work on MS53, which was more harder. As we need to delete an 
item and resize the array after doing that. I had numerous challanges while doing this
 one. Firstly,I was not being able to select the correct row to delete as I was writing
 Iptr[row] which was selecting the next number to delete. But after some time I realized
 that array start from zero and I need to subtract 1 from the rows to get it correct.Secondly,
 I was not being I was not being able to display the item to be deleted in a form format.
 To solve I, used displayType method which allocates type to the mdisplayType. And than
 called the write function. And it worked. Adding more to it, MS54 was a straight forward
 one. As I didn't had any issues.I just needeed to make some changes to my integerInput method
 to get it done.
